These Python codes are used to scan a range of ports on a target IP address using the nmap library, which is a tool commonly used for network discovery and security auditing. 
Summary:

Target IP: The code targets a specific IP address (e.g. 10.20.10.10).

Port Range: The code scans ports from 1 to 150 on the target IP.

nmap Scan: It uses the nmap Python library to scan each port and check whether it's open or closed.

Results: The status of each port is printed to the console, showing whether the port is open, closed, or in some other state.

Key Points:
Port Scanning: This script performs a basic TCP port scan on a specified IP address, checking whether the ports are open or closed.
nmap Library: The script leverages the nmap library to handle the scanning, making it easier to integrate nmap's functionality into a Python script.
Use Cases: This type of port scanning is useful for network administrators and security professionals to assess which services are running on a networked machine and whether any ports are open to unauthorized access.
